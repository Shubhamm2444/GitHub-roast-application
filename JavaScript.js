Example (Conceptual):

function roastUser(username) {
  // Simulate fetching follower count (replace with actual API call)
  const followerCount = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000); // Random number

  let roastMessage;
  if (followerCount < 10) {
    roastMessage = `Looks like your code is more private than Fort Knox!  (Maybe try contributing to some open-source projects to get noticed.)`;
  } else if (followerCount < 50) {
    roastMessage = `You've got a small but loyal following. Keep up the good work! (And maybe try reaching out to the coding community a bit more.)`;
  } else {
    roastMessage = `Hey, coding rockstar! With ${followerCount} followers, you must be writing some impressive stuff.`;
  }

  return roastMessage;
}

// Example usage (assuming user input is in a variable called 'githubUsername')
const roast = roastUser(githubUsername);
console.log(roast); // Display the roast message


** Ethical Considerations:
Remember that roasts are meant to be fun and lighthearted. Avoid crossing the line into mean-spiritedness or targeting personal attacks.
Provide an option for users to opt out of being roasted.
Consider a disclaimer on your application acknowledging that roasts are for entertainment purposes only.

  Remember:
Respectful humor is key.
Focus on the code, not the person.
Make it a fun experience for everyone!
